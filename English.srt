1
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,690
Flesh and sin die.

2
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,410
Die with Christ, that's it.
Rise with Christ.

3
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,660
That's it. Holy Spirit, come.
Holy Spirit come, set her free.

4
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,080
Die with Christ.

5
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,430
Holy Spirit, more.

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,110
Come with your Holy Spirit.
Fill me up.

7
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,110
Just words started coming.

8
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,160
Thank you, Lord!

9
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,760
What was I doing?
- What?

10
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,100
What was I doing?

11
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,040
What you were doing?
You were praying in tongues.

12
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,390
Does it hurt?
- No.

13
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,350
Not at all?
- No.

14
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,650
In Jesus' name,
I thank you. Amen.

15
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,630
It's done!
Hallelujah!

16
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,030
...over one month
and she is in shock.

17
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,460
It's Jesus.

18
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,010
I used to watch
these things on TV

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,640
and sometimes I do not believe,
but today I do believe

20
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,930
because it happens to me.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,710
Pain, go now.

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,840
And you can do this.
Now get all up.

23
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,520
It's good, yeah?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you Father. Amen.
Try to feel it.

25
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,340
Can you feel any difference?

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Seriously, it does not hurt anymore.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,470
Wow!

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,330
God, I thank you for healing. Thank you,
the pain is going to go.

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Try to feel the head.

30
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,580
No!
I don't feel no pain, bro.

31
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,570
Now the pain is gone.
Now the pain is gone, yes.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,970
We, as the church today, are standing
in front of a new reformation.

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,180
A reformation,
where we are coming back

34
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,720
to what we read
in the Book of Acts.

35
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,470
If you look at the church today,

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,000
it is so different from what we read
in the Book of Acts.

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,400
Because we have like
2000 years of history,

38
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,880
where the church has been changed
again and again.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,030
We can see that the church
in the Book of Acts was a living body.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,060
It was a body of believers
who were led by the Holy Spirit.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
The church was a movement,
a disciples' movement.

42
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,650
Christianity moved to Greece
and became a philosophy.

43
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,040
It came to Italy and
became an institution.

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,420
It came to Europe and
became a culture.

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,680
It came to America and
became a business.

46
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,830
If you take a body and make
a business out of a body

47
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,460
is that not prostitution?

48
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,630
And this is what we have done
today with the church.

49
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,620
We have prostituted the church
of Christ, the body of Christ.

50
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,930
Because of that, we need
to see a reformation,

51
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,000
where we go so much deeper.

52
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,190
Where we are talking about the doctrine,
we are talking about the Spirit,

53
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,920
and we are also talking about the whole
system, the church system.

54
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,590
Why we do church the way we do it.

55
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,600
It's time to go back to what
we read in the Book of Acts.

56
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,150
God is now bringing us
back to the beginning.

57
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,490
What a mighty God we serve.

58
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,450
What a mighty God we serve.

59
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,210
Angels bow down.

60
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,090
Heaven and earth adore Him.

61
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,560
What a mighty God we serve.

62
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,020
What a mighty God we serve.

63
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,860
Angels bow down.

64
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,540
Heaven and earth adore Him.

65
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,260
What makes the Book of Acts
the most unique book of the Bible,

66
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,820
is that the Book of Acts is
the only book in the entire Bible

67
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,030
and all of Scripture,
that shows us

68
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,440
how to actually go out
and make disciples.

69
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,730
If you read the gospels that
lead up to the Book of Acts,

70
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,800
what's interesting is,
that even though these books

71
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,030
were written at a time,
like when they were written,

72
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,870
probably about thirty years
after the cross,

73
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,750
but the time periods covered
are all before the cross.

74
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,270
So we don't see the fullness
of the Christian life there

75
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,020
because Christ hadn't yet died,
he hadn't yet been buried

76
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,420
and resurrected and sent
his Spirit.

77
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,340
So we don't see in the gospels

78
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,150
how they went out
and actually made disciples.

79
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,660
The Holy Spirit had
not yet been given

80
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,480
and plus, we didn't have
the power yet

81
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,310
to go out
and be successful doing this.

82
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,000
And I think that contributes to a lot
of the fear today

83
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,330
for those who don't
know the Holy Spirit.

84
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,340
Because Jesus told them
to go and wait.

85
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,410
He says, "When my Spirit comes,
you will receive power

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,160
and then you will be my witnesses."

87
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,000
It's real!
It's really real!

88
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,840
Amen, it's real!

89
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,840
Hallelujah.
- She just got healed.

90
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,200
Amazing, Jesus.
- Thank you, Jesus.

91
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,700
Look at that, she's walking.

92
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,540
I know in many churches
there is a sign

93
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,140
on the church wall where it's written,

94
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,510
'Jesus is the same yesterday,
today and forever.'

95
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,400
We, today as believers,
believe that

96
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,390
Jesus is the same
yesterday, today and forever.

97
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,230
But if He's the same,
the Holy Spirit is also the same.

98
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,810
And if the Holy Spirit is the same,

99
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,070
what we read in the Book of Acts
should also be the same.

100
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,070
By the power of Jesus Christ, she
gets healed right now.

101
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,790
This man has just healed this lady.

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,580
And he's overwhelmed.

103
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,980
It's done.
- It's done. It is finished.

104
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,420
It is finished, with his cry.

105
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,390
I was walking like this
because I could not move any faster.

106
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,970
What can you do now?

107
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,290
Sister, do like this.

108
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,960
I could not do this.
This I could not do.

109
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,290
And this I could not do.

110
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,670
I would've screamed up the
whole place doing that.

111
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,110
All glory be to His name.

112
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,220
In the Book of Acts we see the
very early Christians,

113
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,970
the very early
disciples of Christ.

114
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,760
They were living this
lifestyle of discipleship.

115
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,390
They were reaching people
in their homes, on the streets.

116
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,180
They met people
where they were at.

117
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,190
And the gospel was exploding
and spreading to the entire world.

118
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,730
Thousands and thousands
and thousands of people

119
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
came to faith in Jesus Christ

120
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,050
and were baptized
and received the Holy Spirit.

121
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,820
But at one point in church history,
we see that

122
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,780
Christianity was institutionalized and
soon became a state religion.

123
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,460
This hierarchy & institutionalized church
was following us through the reformation

124
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,170
where Luther, Calvin
and Zwingli came.

125
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,170
They were trying to reform and bring
us back to the real gospel,

126
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,050
back to the Book of Acts.

127
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,180
But they failed.

128
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,680
We still have the building.
We still have the special priesthood.

129
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,720
We still have people meeting
in special buildings,

130
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,520
on special dates, with a hierarchy
and people trying

131
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,510
to bring offerings to the church
to gain the favor of God.

132
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,820
Luther did not succeed in bringing
the church back

133
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,570
to what we read in the Book of Acts.

134
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
The Bible is the book of life.

135
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,330
And it doesn't become
the book of life by studying it.

136
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,150
It becomes the book of life
by living it.

137
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,770
I command the pain in this hand
to go, in Jesus' name.

138
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,320
Try to do it again.

139
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,070
It's gone.

140
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,130
What's this?

141
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,240
In Jesus' name,
right now. Amen.

142
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,000
Check it.

143
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,710
It's gone.

144
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,960
Amen.

145
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,380
Go, right now, in the name of Jesus.
Try again.

146
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,400
Bones, I command you to mend
right now in Jesus' name.

147
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,100
Try it out.

148
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,580
Is it similar to Reiki?
- No, Jesus.

149
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,750
Jesus, not Reiki.
- No, no. No energy?

150
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,670
God. No, it's not energy.

151
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,780
Thank you, Jesus.

152
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,390
What do you think about
what just happened?

153
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,930
It's cool.
- It's pretty cool?

154
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,810
We are born, put here on earth
with a purpose.

155
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,100
That is, to seek and find God.

156
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,100
The problem is that we
don't seek Him.

157
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,190
Because we don't seek Him,
we don't find Him.

158
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
Have you heard about Jesus?

159
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,900
We live 2015 years
after Jesus Christ.

160
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,990
God is real and He called us
to be His disciples,

161
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,790
Jesus' disciples, to go out
and show the world He is real.

162
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,290
Fifth of April, 1995, I repented.

163
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,460
I recognized I have sinned
and gave my life to Jesus

164
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,670
and a light came into my body and
I fell to the floor, and I met God.

165
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,800
When you become a born-again Christian,
the Spirit of God comes and lives in you

166
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,970
and you get to do the things Jesus did.

167
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,640
The Bible says that we should be
doers of the Word

168
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,500
and not only hearers.

169
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,550
If we only hear the Word and do not
do it, we are deceiving ourselves.

170
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,300
We are like a man
looking in a mirror

171
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,640
but as soon as we go away,
we have forgotten what we saw.

172
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,320
Sunday after Sunday there are
millions of Christians

173
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,730
who are sitting in church and
listening to the Word of God.

174
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,110
But as soon as they go away,
they have forgotten what they heard.

175
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,770
As a pastor,
in the last couple of years

176
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,570
I started to get really hungry.
I would read through the Book of Acts

177
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,200
and I became angry at the way
that I saw things happening

178
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,120
in the Book of Acts, and I didn't
see this happening

179
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,410
in my church, or in my own life,

180
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,250
or with the eldership,
or the structure of the church at all.

181
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,290
We weren't just going out
& healing people.

182
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,000
We would lay hands on people
and tell them to go home

183
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,160
and they'll get better maybe,
in the future, or maybe not.

184
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,550
But what I read in the Book of Acts
is that the Apostles

185
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,140
were going out and they
were just doing this stuff daily.

186
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,220
I really felt that
that's what I wanted.

187
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,100
So for two years I've been
hungry for this stuff,

188
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,190
believing that this is
what I was called to do,

189
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,110
but I hadn't really
been able to do it.

190
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,030
The church system has to change.

191
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:27,700
We have to stop being a building-focused,
Sunday service-attending institution.

192
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,870
People are sitting in churches,
year after year

193
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,790
waiting, waiting for that special minister
to come and pray for them

194
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,130
saying, now you have the anointing.

195
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,920
You can go out and you can do
this or that for God.

196
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,390
Or they are just sitting there,
hoping that someone

197
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,390
will see them,
see their talents.

198
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,560
And that is not what we see the
Bible telling us to do.

199
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,210
That is not what we see
Jesus telling us to do.

200
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,940
In 1995, I was working as a baker
and I didn't know anything about God.

201
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,190
I didn't know anything
about the Bible.

202
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,990
I was as a young boy in Denmark,
baptized in the Lutheran Church.

203
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,410
I was confirmed in the
Lutheran Church when I was fourteen.

204
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,750
But it was tradition.
It's tradition for many people today.

205
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,790
One night I looked up in the air and said,
"Come on God, are You there?

206
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,250
If You are there, come and take me.
I want to know You."

207
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,170
And a short time after,
I heard the gospel

208
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,100
and the fifth of April, 1995,
9:30 in the evening,

209
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,810
I repented

210
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,770
and I gave everything to Jesus.

211
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,290
But then I started
to come in a church.

212
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,590
And I started to become like
the people in the church.

213
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,150
And I thought it was Christianity, to

214
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,910
meet God and then come to a church
and sit there every Sunday.

215
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,060
But I got more and more frustrated.

216
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,790
Because I was like, "Come on, there must
be more than just going to a church,

217
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,790
sitting there two hours every Sunday

218
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,540
and listening to somebody preaching."

219
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,530
And at one time, I started to
just read the Book of Acts,

220
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,700
read about the first Christians,
how they were living.

221
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,310
And they didn't do the same
as I was doing.

222
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,520
They saw how lives got changed
where they came.

223
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,650
And at that time I was so frustrated,
because I had been a Christian

224
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,610
like many years.

225
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,360
But I had never healed the sick,
never cast out a demon.

226
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,570
I had never led anybody to Christ.
I had never experienced the life

227
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,580
we read about in the first church
in the Book of Acts.

228
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,040
So one day in frustration,
I was like,

229
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,250
"God, I give you everything.
I want to see this life."

230
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,880
And then I started to see this life,
more and more and more.

231
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,970
But the problem was
that in the beginning

232
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,010
there was nobody
who could disciple me.

233
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,520
There was nobody, like Jesus did
when Jesus said,

234
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,190
"Come and follow Me
and I will make you fishers of men."

235
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,690
Come and follow Me,
I will show you

236
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,190
how to heal the sick,
how to preach the gospel.

237
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,110
I will show you, train you, in how you can
be effective in the Kingdom of God.

238
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,530
Nobody did that.

239
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,780
But what is different now,
is that

240
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,370
now we are starting
to disciple people.

241
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,870
And if we take what we
have learned and give it

242
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,710
to the next generation of disciples
and they continue from there,

243
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,220
and then take that and give it
to the next generation of disciples,

244
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,880
in a very short time,
we will have disciples

245
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,890
walking around on earth,
looking exactly like Jesus,

246
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,020
doing the same things Jesus did.
Yes, even greater things

247
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,000
because He went to the Father.

248
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,600
I've prepared the best for you.

249
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:58,440
Yes I have prepared a place of rest.

250
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:05,860
I've prepared the best for you.

251
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,780
Yes I have prepared a place of rest.

252
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:20,250
And in that place:
Life in abundance.

253
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,590
In that promised land...

254
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,470
Now we will listen
to a friend of ours, Simon Ådahl.

255
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,010
In Swedish.

256
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,270
Sweden rules, man!

257
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,920
Father, I pray that
we will take Europe,

258
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,440
also Denmark, and Norway
and the whole world for You!

259
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,040
I became a Christian about
eleven years ago.

260
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,230
And I came into
the Swedish state church

261
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,440
from a totally
non-Christian background.

262
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,820
After a while, me and my wife,
we moved to another city

263
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,830
and we came into
a very big church there.

264
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,570
We became leaders in a big
outreach work there in church.

265
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,360
We were supposed to be an example
but I had never led anybody to Christ,

266
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,630
I had never
baptized anybody myself,

267
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,180
I had never seen anybody with my own eyes
who I prayed for getting healed.

268
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,350
I came to a point when
one night we were out

269
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,600
and there came a man to my table
actually, and he asked,

270
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,190
"Yeah, I see what you do,
I want to become a Christian.

271
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,190
How do I do it?"

272
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,190
And my reaction was,
"Okay, I pick you up tomorrow

273
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,860
and I bring you to church."

274
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,660
So I did that.
I brought him to church

275
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,440
and I brought him to the pastor
and the pastor led him to salvation.

276
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,040
But that made me react. I understood
that something was wrong,

277
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,380
'cause I read the Bible a lot, I went
to Bible school for a couple years

278
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,090
I know what the Bible said
and I was the one

279
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,880
who was supposed
to do these things.

280
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,220
I was the one who was supposed
to lay hands on the sick

281
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,050
and they will recover.
I was the one

282
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,890
who was supposed to baptize people,
and I didn't do it.

283
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,210
Something was wrong.

284
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,940
I started to think,
maybe they are lying,

285
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,400
maybe it's not true,
what people are telling me.

286
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,230
So I started to go out.

287
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,900
Every morning I woke up
and just prayed to the Lord.

288
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,240
And it was raining sometimes,
snow, bad weather,

289
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,160
I just went out because I was
really crying out to the Lord.

290
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,940
I want to know You.
I want to have the real life.

291
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:52,420
And one day I was at work and I was
reading a Christian newspaper.

292
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,110
There was a small note there
about a Danish man

293
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,380
who was in
a shopping mall in Sweden

294
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,640
praying for sick people
and they got healed.

295
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,600
And I was like, "What?"
I saw this kind of article before

296
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,270
but this just took my heart,
and I felt that this is God.

297
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,250
So I called him and he answered.
He was a normal man like me.

298
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,270
We spoke and I told him
about my journey

299
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,820
and he thought,
this is amazing, we should meet.

300
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,260
So I gathered a couple of friends
and we went down to him in Denmark.

301
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,600
Then he asked us,
"Why did you come to Denmark?"

302
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,440
We said,
"We want to see people get healed."

303
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,960
Then he said,
"Okay, in about fifteen minutes

304
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,210
you'll see the first person
get healed."

305
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,700
I was like, " yeah, yeah."
I could not believe this.

306
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,130
How can this be a part
of my life?

307
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,620
But we went out on the streets
and we came to a gang of people,

308
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,790
maybe about 25, 30 years old.

309
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,960
One of the girls had a problem
with her knee for many years.

310
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,900
He told me to lay my hands
on her knee

311
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,300
and command the pain to go away.

312
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,930
I almost blacked out,
I was so nervous.

313
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,660
And I had no faith, either, I think.
I said, okay I do it.

314
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,650
So I did it and she like jumped up.
"What?"

315
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,750
And she got healed.

316
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,550
And the whole crowd was like...
This rocked my world.

317
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,050
I just realized, this is true.
This is true.

318
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,410
This actually was enough for me.

319
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,330
I prayed for one person
and then I went by myself.

320
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,170
We, as Christians, are called
to make disciples.

321
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,090
Another word we have started
using is the word 'kickstarting'.

322
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,110
It's like if you have a motorbike
and you want

323
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,680
to start the engine,
you kickstart it.

324
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,410
And when that motorbike is started
you can drive all over the place.

325
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,600
In the same way, we as Christians
need to get kickstarted

326
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,750
in doing the things
Jesus has called us to.

327
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,000
When we, for example, kickstart
a Christian in healing the sick,

328
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,090
we take them out on the streets
and say, "Come and follow us."

329
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,880
And then we show them
how to do it.

330
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,060
And when they have done it one time,
they can do it again.

331
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,270
You say you have pain all over
your body, most in your legs?

332
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,460
Yeah.
And we'll pray for it; you'll see it.

333
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,770
I command all pain,
leave right now.

334
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,650
Be healed right now
in the whole body.

335
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,940
I command all pain,
leave the body right now.

336
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,400
The whole body, right now.

337
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,220
I pray for healing right now,
in the name of Jesus. Amen.

338
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,980
Just move, try to move it.

339
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,560
Try to feel it.

340
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,540
It felt good.
- It felt good, yeah?

341
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,860
But do you feel the pain now?

342
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,110
No.
- It's gone? Yeah.

343
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,340
People get surprised.

344
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,590
I command this back to be
totally restored, right now.

345
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,430
Bend over like this,
try to feel it.

346
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,140
And up again.
- For real, it is gone.

347
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,890
For real.
- What?

348
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,440
I swear.
- I am not making things up.

349
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,800
You can feel it. It just went away.
- Oh, yes. Oh, my God.

350
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,450
This is growing all over the world.

351
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,910
The last years we have seen

352
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,770
hundreds of thousands
of people getting healed.

353
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,460
By normal believers,
who get kickstarted

354
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,630
and start to go out
and heal the sick.

355
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,160
And those people now start
to lead other people to Christ.

356
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,720
So the last years we have seen
thousands of people coming to Christ.

357
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,600
And this is really powerful.

358
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,440
I came to Stockholm
and met this brother

359
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,190
and he was there with a bunch of guys,
and his wife was there, too.

360
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,490
And there we went out.

361
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,530
He first stopped
this person who had pain

362
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,280
and he placed his hand on this person,
and this person got healed.

363
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,040
And I was just like,
Wow, this is amazing!

364
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,330
This person got healed
and I was like,

365
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,170
now it's not on YouTube anymore.

366
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,750
I am not watching this on YouTube,
but now I see it in front of me.

367
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,220
It was amazing, seeing the reaction
of this person who got healed.

368
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,760
The next thing that happened was
that this lady came

369
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,060
and she had pain in her stomach.

370
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,270
This man, that was
kickstarting me was like,

371
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,560
Now it is your time to pray.
Just place your hand

372
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,480
and command the pain to go.
So I just placed my hand

373
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,860
and I was hesitating,
but I placed my hand

374
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,030
and just commanded,
"In Jesus' name, pain go."

375
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,030
I just removed my hand and suddenly,
you should have seen

376
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,330
the face of this woman.
She was like, how did you do that?

377
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,160
What?

378
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,920
Are you kidding me?
- No, we are not kidding.

379
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,240
This is true, and that is
why we do this.

380
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,820
No.

381
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,720
This is sick.

382
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,550
Jesus healed you, not me.

383
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,350
Wow, I have never been
in such a thing before,

384
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,140
and my dreams just
came true, right there.

385
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,980
This is actually
the best day of my life.

386
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,320
Being part of what I have been
longing for, for such a long time.

387
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,030
So on my way back home
I was so filled up with joy.

388
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,490
So I was sitting in the bus
going home.

389
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,700
When I arrived, I could not
just sit or just like go home.

390
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,540
I just went around in the city downtown
and I was praying for people

391
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,710
and the very same day,
and I came across these girls

392
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,420
that I prayed for and they
got healed instantly as well.

393
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,710
I was like, Wow!

394
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,260
So this is not something that happened
in Stockholm and stayed there.

395
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,720
It continues, you know.

396
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,930
Ever since then, I was
going out every day.

397
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,850
Every day I was out on the streets and
I've seen thousands getting healed.

398
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,630
It just changed me.
It changed the entire me.

399
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,800
It's, WOW!

400
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,810
Move your leg.

401
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,230
I do not feel anything.

402
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,450
It disappeared?

403
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,020
I cannot feel it.
- No.

404
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,650
I cannot feel it.

405
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,300
I cannot feel it.

406
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,920
Is it not strange?
- Yes.

407
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,820
It was Jesus who healed you.

408
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,120
Bend over and try to feel it.

409
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,880
It worked, Dennis.
- Try it. Try it.

410
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,070
How does it feel now?
- It feels perfect.

411
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,510
All pain is gone?
- All pain is totally gone.

412
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,850
I swear to God.

413
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,480
Thank you, Jesus.

414
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,040
I was not expecting what we saw,
I kinda was... this is supposed to happen.

415
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,580
I have seen it happen
in videos all the time

416
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,590
but I've never been able
to do it myself

417
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,130
and I fully expected
that this is what God does.

418
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,660
This is what He uses me for.
This is my purpose here.

419
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,510
We prayed for one girl
who had some issues with the back.

420
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,980
I think she had
some kind of surgery.

421
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,900
Pain, go right now.
Back, go in place right now,

422
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,590
in the name of Jesus.

423
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,860
I don't know if you feel
something happening.

424
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,280
Oh, snap.
- Wow, something happened.

425
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,820
She got filled with the Holy Spirit
and God met her in a radical way.

426
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,370
She was in tears.
- She fell down in front of us.

427
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,080
Fill her up.
More, more.

428
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,150
The Holy Spirit is over you,
just open your mouth.

429
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,450
Holy Spirit, more, more, more.
Fill her up.

430
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,830
You just got baptized,
filled with the Spirit.

431
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
He is there, He is there.

432
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,510
This is a new beginning.
It's a new beginning for you.

433
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,720
It's a new beginning.

434
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,850
God, we thank You for freedom.
God, we thank You for a new beginning.

435
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,620
Her family that was with her,
her sister-in-law and her kids,

436
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,580
were just totally at peace;
like everything's normal, and

437
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,330
people walking by,
"What's going on?"

438
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,420
And I just remember thinking,

439
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,630
This is so cool, what's happening
to this girl right now.

440
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,180
She had no idea what would
happen that day.

441
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,100
She got back up and you could
tell she was a different person.

442
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,420
God had changed her
from the inside out.

443
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,690
I'm okay, Lillia, I'm okay.

444
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,010
This is good.
- Way more than okay.

445
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,630
Way better than just okay.

446
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,780
God, He wants to be alive.
He wants to show us

447
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,430
and show who He is to us.

448
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,220
And see, this is God.
This is outside here.

449
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,290
Not in a fine church,
but God is there

450
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
and He wants to be part
of our life.

451
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,920
He wants to be part of your life.

452
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,500
Then we moved on from there.

453
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,380
Then we prayed for
a guy named Danny.

454
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,550
Right, first we asked for
another guy if he had any pain.

455
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,640
He said, "No."
And then Danny came.

456
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,310
Right. We asked a gentleman
on a bench if we could pray.

457
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,310
He said, "No, no, no, I'm okay."
And a guy named Danny said,

458
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,190
"Oh, my back really hurts."
- "For how long?"

459
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,110
"For ten years."
Actually it was five years

460
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,490
that this man's back hurt.
And so we said,

461
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,330
"Okay cool, well let's sit you down."
And we sat him down

462
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,040
and his one leg was longer than
the other by about half an inch.

463
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,210
Leg grow, loosen and grow
right now in the name of Jesus.

464
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,400
There it is.
- Yeah, whoa, there is movement.

465
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,670
Did you feel that?
- And it moved in your hands.

466
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,760
Something popped
when it came out.

467
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,180
Danny, try to stand up
and feel your back now.

468
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,180
That is pretty good.
- Is it gone?

469
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,640
Yeah.
- Fifteen years, and it's gone.

470
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,710
Yeah, well five.
- Oh, five years, and it's gone now.

471
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,010
What did you experience?
- I don't know, I felt it's good.

472
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,180
This is the first time
he does this.

473
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,700
That was awesome, and while
looking for more people

474
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,240
we decided to go get some ice cream.

475
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,960
We went in and you talked to
the lady behind the counter.

476
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,620
There was a woman
behind the counter

477
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,090
and she asked what we were doing,
where we were from, and

478
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,460
so we explained to her,
"Oh, we're going around and praying.

479
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,630
I am from Houston and we
are with people from all over

480
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,370
and we're praying for people
with sickness or pain."

481
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,970
She said, "Really?"
I told about Danny.

482
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,980
She said, "Oh my gosh,
I want to meet this guy."

483
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,400
I thought she meant Danny,
who got healed.

484
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,810
"I don't know where he is, sorry."

485
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,530
She said, "Whenever he comes
back to pray, you let me know."

486
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,720
In my mind, I thought,
"That was me! I'm right here."

487
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,830
So, yeah I'll come back,
just a minute.

488
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,410
And she came around the
counter and took off her shoe.

489
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,330
"It is this ankle."
She opened up

490
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,690
and I continued praying for her.
It got better and better.

491
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,920
I turn around and there
are 4 or 5 people saying,

492
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,410
"I have pain."
"Could you pray for me?"

493
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,510
How is it?
- What are you doing?

494
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,580
It wasn't me, man.
- I was in pain.

495
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,250
I'm not lying.

496
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,270
Is it gone completely?

497
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,590
Come on, jump, jump!
- I can do it now.

498
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,530
What are you doing? Jesus.
- It's Jesus.

499
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,060
Go down, go down, go down!

500
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,580
When could you do that last time?

501
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,500
In the military.
- Ten years ago?

502
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,130
Yeah, ten years ago.
- So you couldn't do this for ten years?

503
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,340
No. Every time I can't.

504
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,800
Come on!
- No, I know it feels good.

505
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,510
Sit in the chair.
See if you can do this quick as usual.

506
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,750
And then stand up.

507
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,350
If this is God, then...
I love you.

508
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,980
It is God! Ten years you have
not been able to do that.

509
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,730
No, I haven't;
I've been in pain,

510
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,530
always going to the
doctors, in & out.

511
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,350
But Jesus is the great Doctor.
He is the highest and He is there.

512
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,370
He is. Amen.

513
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,490
What is wrong with you?
- My arm.

514
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,370
You cannot lift it
higher than that? No.

515
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,960
How long have you had that?
- Like six weeks.

516
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,920
So in six weeks you have not
been able to do like this.

517
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,700
Be loosened right now
in the name of Jesus, right now.

518
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,210
You got it!

519
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,310
You got it.
It's yours, keep it.

520
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,190
Before you could get to here
and it would hurt, right?

521
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,680
Moving better, yeah?

522
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,200
It's good.
- Up with your hand!

523
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,100
Give me five.

524
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,860
You feel good?

525
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,340
Now we know what it's like.
Yeah.

526
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:20,060
So we get to go back to Houston
and go find parks and stores.

527
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,360
When we eat pizza somewhere...
that's not off-limits for God.

528
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,530
Yeah, it is like a redhead
growing up in Asia thinking,

529
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,740
"I feel like there has to be more
in life. Everybody is the same."

530
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,280
and then going to Ireland.

531
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,580
"There is, there really is!
There are people like me!"

532
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,330
That is how I feel, like,
"Oh, this is life, okay good."

533
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,500
That is what I wanted,
and now I can go and do that.

534
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,290
Yeah, so we are excited
to go back and I just feel like...

535
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,050
Man! My neighbors, the people, they have
no idea what is about to hit them.

536
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,410
Because I get it now, I can do this.
God, I can absolutely do this.

537
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,950
We're living in
really exciting times in Europe,

538
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:21,440
we're beginning to see a reenactment
of the Book of Acts in our times.

539
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,370
We're seeing that people
are going out with the gospel,

540
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,710
with the demonstration
of the Kingdom.

541
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,750
And it is often
a very clear gospel message,

542
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,450
about turning away
from one's sins, and

543
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,720
part of the package is actually

544
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,810
baptism and being filled
with the Holy Spirit.

545
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,630
So often in our church systems
they are separated.

546
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,690
But what we are seeing
more and more,

547
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,020
it's coming together
into one stream,

548
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,860
like it was in the Book of Acts.

549
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,690
So there's no waiting.

550
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,240
So when somebody repents
and expresses faith in Jesus,

551
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,560
they are taken
wherever there is water.

552
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,120
And it can be anywhere;
it can be a lake,

553
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:13,880
it can be in a rainwater tub,
it can be in a bath, or wherever.

554
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,680
People are baptized immediately

555
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,470
and at the same time,
also filled with the Holy Spirit.

556
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,010
The first words that
came out of Jesus' mouth, were,

557
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,630
"Repent, the Kingdom of God is near."

558
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,130
And we are called
to preach repentance today.

559
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,190
And it's like that part has been lost
in the church today.

560
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,070
We are talking about faith,
but we do not talk about repentance.

561
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,640
They are almost afraid
to talk about sin.

562
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,290
But we are called
to talk about sin.

563
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,370
We are called to preach repentance.

564
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,030
We have to say what sin is.

565
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,750
We have to say that those people

566
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,300
who continue in sin,
are going to die.

567
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,430
We have to talk about sin
before we talk about

568
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,920
that Jesus was the Lamb of God,
who came to remove our sin.

569
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,940
Because if we don't talk about sin,
what should people then do with Jesus?

570
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,070
Where are you going?
- I go with God, to heaven.

571
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,220
Why?
- Because...

572
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,730
Are you a good person?
- Yeah.

573
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,540
Have you ever lied?
- Yeah.

574
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,320
Have you ever stolen anything?

575
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,920
Downloaded something without paying?
- Yes.

576
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,160
Have you had sex outside of marriage?

577
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,220
These are three
of the ten commandments.

578
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,180
How many shall I go through?

579
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,970
It's all about how we compare
ourselves to each other.

580
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,640
Of course, if you compare yourself
to people around you,

581
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,520
you can think
you are a good person.

582
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,060
The question is not if you
think you're a good person.

583
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,860
The question is,
Are you good enough?

584
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,690
The Bible says, if you have just
done one of the sins,

585
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,530
you are guilty of them all.

586
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,830
It's not like in other things,
like it's okay if you weigh

587
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,790
and you have bad deeds
and the good...

588
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,830
It is not like that.
It is guilty or not guilty.

589
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,210
If you have once broken the law,
you are guilty of breaking the law.

590
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,510
If we talk about God,
no person can ever

591
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,590
come to God, come to heaven
by our good deeds.

592
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,500
It is not possible.

593
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,020
And I have always thought
I was a good person because,

594
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,100
yes, I have been
fighting a little too much,

595
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,980
I have been drinking too much.
I have been doing things, but...

596
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:40,990
this person and this person
is much worse than me.

597
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,490
So my problem was that I compared
myself to people around me,

598
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,490
instead of comparing myself
to the One

599
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,450
I am going to stand
in front of one day.

600
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,920
I believe we have to get back
to what the Bible shows us.

601
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,920
Repentance isn't so much
feeling sorry about our sins

602
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,460
and what we've done

603
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:06,120
and how we've violated God's Word,
in the sense of ourselves.

604
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,390
Being sorry is not true repentance.

605
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,810
It's part of it,
but it is not the full story.

606
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,230
We see Pharaoh in the Old Testament
with the Israelites in Egypt.

607
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,320
He was sorry. He proclaimed,
"Oh, I have sinned against God."

608
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,860
So he confessed his sin, but he
did not turn away from his sin.

609
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,280
Neither is it just remorse.

610
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,830
A lot of people say that,
"You see, they're really sorry;

611
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,410
they're crying
because they have true remorse."

612
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,120
Judas in the New Testament,
he had remorse.

613
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,880
He was so remorseful
that he actually committed suicide,

614
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,880
but he did not
turn away from his sin.

615
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,550
When we read the Bible, we can
see that God brackets repentance

616
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,890
with forgiveness,

617
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,710
rather than forgiveness
with faith in Jesus.

618
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:56,730
And I think, looking at it in
the latter part, we often think that

619
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,050
with faith in Jesus, God
automatically forgives us our sins.

620
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,550
And as you read the Bible,
you discover that's not the case.

621
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,490
Let's imagine you and me
play chess together.

622
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,850
I move, and then it's your turn.

623
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,730
I want to see you move.

624
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,900
My turn. Your turn.

625
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:21,040
Am I now allowed to do this?
Move one there, and one there.

626
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,760
Am I allowed to move two times?
- No.

627
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,170
Why? Because there are rules.

628
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,800
And the rules are that you move
one time, then I move one time.

629
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,220
When it comes to God,
you have sinned.

630
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,480
You have done something
that's wrong

631
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,260
and because of that,
you are divided from God.

632
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:44,030
You can not have fellowship with God
because of our sin.

633
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,900
Our sin causes that God
cannot have fellowship with us.

634
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,740
God is looking at you and says,

635
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,160
"I don't want to punish you,
but I am holy, so I need to do it."

636
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,290
"But at the same time, I want
to give you a chance

637
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,080
to get forgiveness
and get a relationship with Me,

638
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,460
so I sent my son, Jesus,
to die for you."

639
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,630
So it's like this.

640
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,970
You have sinned and broke
the commandments of God.

641
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,680
That's why we are living
without fellowship with God.

642
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,060
We are living our own life,
divided from God.

643
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:18,350
God looked down on you and said,
"I don't want to judge you,

644
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,770
I want to forgive you, so I send
my son, Jesus, to die for you."

645
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,940
Whose turn is it now?
Your turn.

646
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,400
God wants to forgive.
He wants to set you free.

647
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,910
He wants to give you a new life
and heal through you.

648
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,620
He wants to do those things,
but he says,

649
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,120
"Move, it is your turn!"
He is waiting for you to do it.

650
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,250
But as soon as you say, I repent,
and receive that forgiveness.

651
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,170
As soon as you do this,
God is like, "I'm going to forgive you."

652
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,720
It is so important
to understand,

653
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,840
because there's so many people...
I had that at one time.

654
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,510
Like you, I believed
there was a God.

655
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,270
But in my mind, in my universe,
"Okay, when it's time,

656
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,520
He will come to me.
It's up to Him.

657
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,690
He's great. He can do
it when he wants to."

658
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,150
And I moved the responsibility
from me over to Him.

659
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,110
A true deep repentance
requires action.

660
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,910
It's not just a word; it's
not just something that we think.

661
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,370
True repentance is
not only realizing

662
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,710
that you have sinned
against a holy God,

663
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,960
but that you then
confess your sins to him,

664
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,210
you are remorseful to Him,

665
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,550
and you turn away
from that sinful life

666
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,170
and you start living His life.

667
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,340
The word for repent in the Bible
is the word 'metanoia'

668
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:36,830
which means to 'again think'.

669
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,750
And God wants us to think again.

670
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,380
About our lives
and how we've lived.

671
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,220
If we will have a rethink about God
and how our sins affect Him,

672
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:55,770
then God will also have a rethink
about what he thinks about us.

673
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,050
And if you confess your sin
and get it out in the light,

674
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,920
you experience forgiveness.

675
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,390
But if you keep it close,
every time you take a step

676
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,430
toward the light,
Satan is going to say,

677
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,430
"But remember, but remember..."
- Yes, that's what he does.

678
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,600
But now it's out.
You have confessed it.

679
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,800
You have said it to me;
you have said it.

680
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,280
Be led by the Holy Spirit; maybe you
should say it to the whole world.

681
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,260
I don't know what,
but there is forgiveness.

682
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,910
People need to hear this.
There is freedom.

683
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,500
There's so many girls
going through it, so many women.

684
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,370
And they have done exactly the same,

685
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,610
carried it around,
thirty, forty, fifty years.

686
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,210
This is not where freedom is.

687
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,300
Freedom is what you
experience, right now.

688
00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:01,710
I came today, seeking God
for the gift of tongues.

689
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:09,590
And for anything else in my life
that I may need deliverance from.

690
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:17,720
And over this weekend,
God has delivered me

691
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,140
and blessed me
with the gift of tongues,

692
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,360
and washed me with water baptism.

693
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,360
I've been living
for over thirty years

694
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:40,330
with shame and embarrassment,
as a secret...

695
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:45,170
that when I was in my twenties

696
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,130
I had an abortion.

697
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,170
And each and every day
from that day forward,

698
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,350
the devil has had his way with me.

699
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:04,690
So I've been seeking God, too,
as I was watching Torben's videos.

700
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,830
Telling God,
I can't do it anymore.

701
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,610
Pleading, asking,
wanting to know

702
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,910
if He had forgiveness for me.

703
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:28,380
And then it came that He
led me to come here this weekend.

704
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,310
And I felt led to speak with Torben,

705
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,260
that God had something to say
through him to me.

706
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:47,600
So, I was given the opportunity
by God to be freed.

707
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,570
Delivered from this pain.

708
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,150
Over thirty years, I am free.
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.

709
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,210
Be free.

710
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:13,980
...that when I was in my twenties...
God help me... He has!

711
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:20,220
I had an abortion
and ever since that day,

712
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,280
God has tried to
tell me it's okay,

713
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,770
but the devil just had
that greater hold on my life.

714
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:35,040
He just kept hanging on
and hanging in.

715
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,210
I remember the day
it happened like yesterday

716
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,960
and I feel the pain the same.

717
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,070
It's a new beginning.
It's a new start.

718
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,050
Are you ready to get
baptized to Jesus Christ

719
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,300
to wash away your sins?
- Yes.

720
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,080
So, on your own faith,
we baptize you to Jesus Christ.

721
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:54,310
Die with Christ.
Up with Christ.

722
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,670
Yay!

723
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,220
Free!

724
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,140
Yes!

725
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,910
Come, let's pray for you.

726
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,100
God, we thank You for Elizabeth.
God, we thank You for your freedom.

727
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,290
And when she confessed that,

728
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,950
another woman came up
and confessed the same sin.

729
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,010
And suddenly, her testimony

730
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,160
already brought life and
forgiveness to another.

731
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,870
And that woman, there,
got baptized in water

732
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,790
and she experienced that freedom.

733
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,520
Later we were at a meeting
with eighty people,

734
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:38,440
where she explained
how she had done that,

735
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:45,680
and it was sin, with the abortion,
but Jesus had forgiven her her sins.

736
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,870
When she confessed that,
and shared that testimony

737
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,980
at a meeting with eighty people,

738
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,630
out of that meeting, there came
twelve women to her afterwards

739
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,360
confessing the same.

740
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,550
And here we see the power
in confessing sins,

741
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:09,220
the power of baptism in water,
and what the gospel is all about.

742
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:14,080
"He who believes and is baptized
shall be saved," Jesus said.

743
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,230
What's really interesting
about water baptism is that...

744
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,580
I believe that through
time and tradition

745
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,780
today, we look at a sacrament
very different

746
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,910
than what the Bible shows us
a sacrament really is.

747
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:52,040
Often we look at a sacrament as an
outward sign of an inward reality.

748
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,270
And what's interesting
about that definition

749
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,850
is that it takes the spiritual
and the physical

750
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,300
and it completely separates
these two things.

751
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,440
And as a result,
we only see baptism

752
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,760
as something that's
just ceremonial

753
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,660
and has no connection with
anything in the spiritual realm.

754
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,240
In other words, it's
just like a confirmation

755
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,310
of something that's
already taken place in the spirit.

756
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,980
But baptism is very,
very different from that.

757
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,750
What we've discovered,
is that baptism

758
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,880
is not something
that's just sacramental,

759
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,870
as far as being an outward sign
of an inward reality.

760
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,640
We're seeing that when
you go into that water,

761
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,930
the Spirit of God is touching that.

762
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:38,290
And when the physical and the
spiritual connect in water baptism,

763
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,300
God does something miraculous.

764
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,150
What's interesting is that
water baptism is two things.

765
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,090
It's both a bath and a burial.

766
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,390
And to have a bath,
you have to be dirty!

767
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,970
So, what does that mean?

768
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:59,000
It means that a person
who's getting baptized

769
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,570
needs to acknowledge
their sins before God.

770
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:09,700
And in that sense, baptism
and repentance go hand in hand.

771
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,870
It's turning
and coming in faith.

772
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,670
And the requirement for baptism,
what God wants us to bring,

773
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,500
is repentance
and faith in Jesus Christ.

774
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,670
A person comes,
dead in their sins,

775
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,730
and what happens is
we take that person,

776
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,930
who's coming in his sins,
bringing proof of repentance,

777
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,370
and then we baptize him.

778
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,230
So when that person comes out,
they are brand new and clean.

779
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,500
I tell many people that we meet,

780
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:47,000
water baptism isn't
just a clean start off.

781
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:52,450
It is a brand new,
clean life to start.

782
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,510
Let it out, let it out.
More, more.

783
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,570
Glory, glory.

784
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,620
Thank you, Jesus.

785
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,830
Thank you, Jesus.

786
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,500
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.

787
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,420
Thank you, Jesus.

788
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,170
Thank you, Jesus.

789
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,430
Thank you, Jesus.

790
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,180
Praise your name. Thank you, Jesus.

791
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,930
Thank you, Jesus.

792
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,640
How do you feel?

793
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,980
I was feeling like something
went out of...

794
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,960
Welling up; it's the living water
that's welling up inside of you

795
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,530
and God is releasing that
through your mouth.

796
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,950
Claudio, you are a brand new man.
- Amen.

797
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,580
You feel good?
- Yeah.

798
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,670
This is just
the beginning, Claudio.

799
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,690
This is just the beginning.
- Yes.

800
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,400
God's given you this gift now.

801
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,320
There's gonna be times where you
may not know what to pray for.

802
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,470
And now you can go
in faith and pray.

803
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,160
You know what's great about
praying in tongues is

804
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,950
that I can concentrate
on other things while praying

805
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,490
because my mind is not praying.

806
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm just letting my mouth
move by faith.

807
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,500
And the Spirit intercedes
through us.

808
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,130
So God just used you.

809
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,820
The Spirit came in
and intercedes through you.

810
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,240
It's beautiful.
- Amen. Thanks, God.

811
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,340
Isn't God good?
- Yes.

812
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,580
He's great.
- Yes, He is.

813
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,130
I've learned something today.

814
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:19,100
The power of water baptism
unto Jesus.

815
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:24,290
It is no longer like a symbol,
like most churches might believe,

816
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,500
like I used to believe,
because that's all I knew.

817
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,750
I just thought it was something
you just go through

818
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,170
with a sprinkle or whatever.

819
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,460
But there's so much power

820
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,700
when you truly believe
what it's all about.

821
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,220
About the death, the burial,
the closure, the old man,

822
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,540
the nature is gone,
and a new man comes up.

823
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,810
As I've learned today,
do you believe

824
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,350
in Jesus as your
Lord and Savior?

825
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,230
Yes, I do.

826
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:54,340
Well, the old man goes under,
you die, and a new man arises.

827
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,530
And as soon as he came up
out of the water,

828
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,070
he said something left him.

829
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,200
A great weight left him and
no longer had any hold on his life.

830
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:08,410
And immediately he received
the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

831
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,440
And this brother was so broken,
he was sobbing.

832
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:15,960
He was just holding his chest.
It was so precious to see.

833
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,010
It was so precious to see
what God was doing in his life.

834
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,430
And all he could do was just weep
in the presence of God.

835
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,100
And for me, just to see
what God had...

836
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,970
He drove, I guess
three, four hours to get here

837
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,600
because this is what he wanted.

838
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,150
And that thing that was
attacking him all this time

839
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:39,590
no longer has power over him,
and he is free. He is totally free.

840
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,700
And I am truly thankful.
So now I have learned

841
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:47,580
that there is something
to water baptism,

842
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,450
there is something
to repentance,

843
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,920
there is something to having
the baptism with the Holy Spirit.

844
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,280
All three things are needed.

845
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,300
And that has truly
changed my life.

846
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,280
And now I preach that message
until the day I die.

847
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:05,800
Because I have experienced it,
and it was one of the most powerful

848
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:11,130
demonstrations of God's love
that I have ever seen.

849
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:14,550
The reason why I believe
we're seeing this happen now

850
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,210
is because when
that old man dies,

851
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,470
demons lose their grip
and their grab.

852
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:25,680
They can no longer
torment a dead man.

853
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,830
Because the old man dies.

854
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,810
And when you come
out of that water,

855
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,520
you're somebody brand new.

856
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,150
There's a new man
wearing your old clothes.

857
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,750
When Jesus was
walking here on earth,

858
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,840
He was preaching repentance.

859
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:47,180
And then He was teaching that
people need to be born again,

860
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,500
out of water and Spirit.

861
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,500
But He could not, at that time,
baptize people in His name.

862
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,920
He could not baptize people
with the Holy Spirit.

863
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,010
But after the cross,
when Peter stood up on Pentecost,

864
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,890
we hear the full gospel for
the first time, when Peter said,

865
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:13,370
"Repent, get baptized for the
forgiveness of your sins,

866
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,570
and you will receive
the Holy Spirit."

867
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,670
Okay, you kneel down and you say,
"I baptize you to Jesus Christ"

868
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,530
and make sure he goes down.

869
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:30,120
Die with Christ.
Up with Christ.

870
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,850
Freedom! Freedom!
Go! Go!

871
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,060
Freedom! Freedom!

872
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,480
Come! Leave! Go! Go! Go!

873
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,030
I command you, spirit go!
Right now! Come out!

874
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,690
Go! In the name of Jesus,
I command this spirit, go!

875
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,110
Leave him, right now!

876
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,870
Out! Out!
Go!

877
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,240
In the name of Jesus, I command
every demon, go, right now!

878
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:58,420
Go! Right now!
Come out!

879
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,880
I command this demon, go!
Go, right now!

880
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:02,920
Demon, go!

881
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:04,960
I command every demon,
leave him right now!

882
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:11,220
Lie, go! Come out!
More, more. Let it go!

883
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:14,560
I command you, demon,
in the name of Jesus, come out!

884
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:21,980
Get out! More!
Go! Go! Go!

885
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,610
In the name of Jesus,
I command the last thing to go!

886
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,930
Go! In the name of Jesus,
every demon, come out!

887
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,810
Right now!
Leave him! Leave him!

888
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:45,950
Fill him up! Fill him up! More!
Freedom! Freedom!

889
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,220
This is real.

890
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,240
Thank you.

891
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,910
This is real!

892
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:38,080
If you want to read a book about
this, I want to recommend a book.

893
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:42,040
Maybe you have heard about it.
The name of the book is the Bible.

894
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,510
This is what
we read in the Bible.

895
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:51,850
He got set free and then
the Holy Spirit took over.

896
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,850
It's not just a picture;
it's real.

897
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,370
And if this is real in the Bible,
what about the rest?

898
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,530
Every word is real,
from the beginning to the end.

899
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,090
Hallelujah!

900
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,200
My friend!

901
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,350
I still remember
clenching my fists,

902
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,670
and I remember
banging on the water,

903
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:25,710
and then I was really
yelling out loud, and then

904
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,690
there was a commotion,
something happening.

905
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,300
I didn't know it was me.
I didn't know what was happening.

906
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,530
I had my eyes closed,
and then I opened my eyes,

907
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,200
and I was in a different position
to where I was before.

908
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:44,610
I was looking,
and Torben was over there,

909
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:48,210
and I was facing this way, and
before, I was facing the other way.

910
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,340
I didn't quite understand why.

911
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:53,200
And then there was
some more commotion.

912
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,260
The last thing I remember
was Torben saying,

913
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,500
"Demons, get out."

914
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:05,090
It was peaceful then;
it just calmed down.

915
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,720
There was quietness and silence.

916
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:15,240
I can remember looking up
and there were loads of people

917
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,110
with all their cameras out.

918
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,280
Many people looked at me

919
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:21,240
and it was like
I was in a bit of a shock.

920
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:25,060
Like coming out of a surgery
and everyone's there.

921
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,420
In terms of how
I can explain it,

922
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,800
through my life
and my experiences,

923
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,090
there's not anything
that's close to this.

924
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,130
But the best thing I have
from my experience

925
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,290
is it's like having
a tooth taken out.

926
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,980
I knew there was
something in there

927
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:49,550
when this commotion was going on,
that had no right to be there.

928
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,820
It's like now that
that tooth has come out,

929
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:56,140
and there's nothing there.
It has come out. Gone.

930
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,950
And there's like new skin there.

931
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,820
When you have
your tooth taken out,

932
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,490
you want to get your tongue
and you want to touch it.

933
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,500
You just creep your tongue over
to where the tooth has come out,

934
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:09,170
to feel what it is like,
and it was like that.

935
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,740
There was something
new and young there,

936
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:16,660
where this tooth had been.

937
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,540
And I'm happy I'm free,
thanks to Jesus Christ.

938
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:25,180
As soon as people get baptized,
I start to pray for them

939
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:28,520
for deliverance because now
they have died with Christ,

940
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:32,480
they have risen up with Christ,
so now Satan has to leave them.

941
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:35,690
And it's really strong
to see deliverance

942
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,700
out there as part of baptism.

943
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:43,990
And it was so powerful.
So many people came and saw it

944
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:50,290
and suddenly there was a multitude
of 150, 200 people looking on.

945
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,250
Right after he got set free,
he got baptized with the Holy Spirit

946
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,160
and spoke in tongues.
It was really powerful.

947
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:00,720
Then we were supposed to baptize

948
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,540
the rest of his family: his son
and his daughter, and his wife.

949
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:09,810
When they came down in
the water, ready to get baptized,

950
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,520
God did something amazing.

951
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:14,230
We read in the gospels today

952
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:17,340
that Jesus got baptized
in the river Jordan.

953
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:20,570
We read the bit when the heavens opened

954
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,810
and the Holy Spirit
came down like a dove.

955
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,270
Me and Lauren,
we were just saying,

956
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:30,250
"Shall we pray that something
like that happens today?

957
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,230
That we see a sign in the sky
when we get baptized?"

958
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:38,050
So when we got baptized,

959
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,010
I was in the water
waiting to get baptized,

960
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,930
and I heard people in
the crowd saying, "Look up!"

961
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:51,730
And I turned and I looked up and
saw 'real' written in the sky.

962
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,060
And it was like my prayer
had been answered

963
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,360
as I was about to get baptized.

964
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,110
Thank you, Jesus.

965
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,260
Everybody pointed and said,
"Look, look up!"

966
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:06,320
And up in the sky,
there had just been an airplane

967
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:09,730
writing in the sky, 'real'.

968
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:14,830
And it was in the same time
that I was praying for her husband

969
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,790
and he got delivered,
and I had been saying,

970
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,670
"This is real.
This is not a picture."

971
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:25,370
"If this is real. Everything we
read in the Bible is real."

972
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,470
And suddenly we saw it,
in the sky,

973
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,290
that God had written, 'real'.

974
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:40,590
real

975
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,720
Torben, look up!
- Yeah, I have seen it.

976
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,600
Yeah, I see it.

977
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,920
We started to preach
the gospel afterwards

978
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:00,840
and many more people
repented and got saved that day.

979
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:06,330
Instead of just baptizing eight
people as we were supposed to,

980
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,850
we baptized more
than thirty people.

981
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,850
Because people who
saw what happened,

982
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,560
saw how people
got delivered from demons,

983
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:17,440
saw how they
received the Holy Spirit,

984
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,400
they also repented
from their sins

985
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:23,800
and came and got baptized
and experienced the same.

986
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,680
The demonic world is so real.
It's very real.

987
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:35,120
I have seen glimpses
of it in churches

988
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:41,090
when evangelists had come,
or so-called "men of God" had come,

989
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,460
people who walk in authority.

990
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,510
They pray for people
and see them manifest.

991
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:48,030
But I had never seen it happen
from my own hand.

992
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,040
The first real experience I had

993
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,220
and probably
the biggest experience

994
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,230
is when my wife and I
baptized someone

995
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,880
for the first time in our home.

996
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:05,050
This person, she was involved in
New Age: Reiki healing,

997
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:10,740
tarot card reading, crystals,
a lot of New Age things.

998
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:16,230
We baptized her and if we had
just left it at that

999
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:20,420
like a normal church service,
we would have smiled,

1000
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:23,990
given her a certificate and
had a cup of coffee afterwards.

1001
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:27,920
But we continued to
pray for her, and pray for her,

1002
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:31,580
and after about two minutes,
the demons started to manifest.

1003
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,830
And one after one, they manifest
and we cast them out.

1004
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,590
And it was the most real,
the most radical experience,

1005
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,440
that I've ever had.

1006
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:47,840
It opened my eyes up
to the battle. This is a fight.

1007
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,580
We are not just asked,
we are not told it's a good idea,

1008
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,270
but we are commanded by Jesus
to cast out demons.

1009
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,440
We're given the responsibility
to set people free in Jesus' name.

1010
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:07,070
Why is there a fight going on?
Because Satan don't like it.

1011
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:10,340
But now we are going
under water and then

1012
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:12,550
she's going to come up
and you are going to see

1013
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:16,390
a freedom. You are going to see
a freedom and a new life.

1014
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,060
Just kneel down.
Don't be afraid. Kneel down.

1015
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:21,140
Just kneel down.
- I cannot.

1016
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:24,810
No, you can, you can.

1017
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,400
In the name of Jesus,
you can, you can.

1018
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,820
It's a new life.
Satan is a liar. Satan is a liar.

1019
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:33,280
He has been lying
and he don't want you

1020
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:35,660
to give everything over
to Jesus Christ.

1021
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:38,330
Because when you give yourself
over, he will set you free

1022
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,690
and Satan is going to lose
and he don't want this.

1023
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,360
You can.

1024
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,340
My knees don't want to bend.

1025
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,010
Go down, in the name of Jesus.

1026
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,090
She wants to, but her knees
don't want to bend.

1027
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,870
She cannot get down.
There is a fight going on.

1028
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,560
In Jesus' name,
God, we thank you.

1029
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,850
Just go down, in the name of Jesus,
just go down.

1030
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,440
Down, down, just go down,
in the name of Jesus.

1031
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:04,850
In the name of Jesus.
In the name of Jesus, go down.

1032
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,590
Go down, go down.
In the name of Jesus, go down.

1033
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,450
Are you ready to get baptized
to Jesus Christ?

1034
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,660
So on your own faith
we baptize you to Jesus Christ.

1035
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,350
Just go down. Die with Christ.
Up with Christ.

1036
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,570
Freedom! Freedom! Satan, go!
Leave her! Leave her, right now!

1037
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:33,840
Come out! Come out!
Leave him! Go!

1038
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:38,710
Come out! Go!
Right now!

1039
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,640
Loose! Loose!

1040
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:46,400
Go! Go! In the name of Jesus,
I command this religious spirit,

1041
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,210
go, right now,
in the name of Jesus!

1042
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,860
Go! Last thing, go!

1043
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,890
Go! Go, in the name of Jesus!

1044
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,470
Go! Right now!

1045
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,410
Go! Go!

1046
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,330
Get out, in the name of Jesus!
Get out!

1047
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,120
Go! Right now! Come out!

1048
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:07,110
Every anger, every fear,
go right now, in the name of Jesus!

1049
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,960
Come out! Right now!
Get out! Get out now!

1050
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,760
Come out, right now!

1051
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,090
I command you, go!

1052
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,050
Go! Go right now!
Freedom! Right now!

1053
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,160
Let it go!

1054
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,350
I command this demon, go!

1055
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,130
I command this spirit to go!

1056
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,010
Get out! Get out! Just now!

1057
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,690
Go, in the name of Jesus!
Go right now, in the name of Jesus!

1058
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,970
Get out right now!

1059
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:45,750
Go! Go! I command every demon,
leave him right now!

1060
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,110
Come out!

1061
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,500
Go, right now in Jesus' name!

1062
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,710
Come out!
Come out, right now!

1063
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,130
Go! Go!
Go, in the name of Jesus!

1064
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,040
I command every spirit, leave him.
Right now! Right now! Come out!

1065
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:03,310
Get out! Get out!
Get out right now in Jesus' name.

1066
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:07,880
Come out! Come out!

1067
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,130
Hallelujah.

1068
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:55,510
Can you experience a freedom?

1069
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,180
You are free.

1070
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:08,230
How is it?
- It's great, thank you!

1071
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,990
Come on, a new life.

1072
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:22,870
Come on, can you see it?
I love it!

1073
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,940
Come on friends, can you see it?

1074
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,610
This is the power in baptism.

1075
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:56,150
Repent from your sins,
towards Jesus Christ.

1076
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,570
It is a battle.
But Satan has lost.

1077
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,580
Jesus is alive.

1078
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:12,750
A new life, a new life.

1079
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,270
Freedom.
- Yes.

1080
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:20,260
Praise the Lord.
Praise Jesus.

1081
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:26,680
Thank you that you are filling her up.
Thank you, thank you.

1082
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:28,810
Amen!

1083
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,150
Amen!

1084
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:37,940
You got the Holy Spirit.
- Yeah.

1085
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,430
He has never spoken
in tongues before now.

1086
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,590
Powerful!

1087
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,240
We have seen so many people

1088
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,870
got delivered from sin
in baptism.

1089
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,330
We have seen
schizophrenic people

1090
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,170
get delivered from demons
in baptism.

1091
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,880
We have seen people
with eating disorders

1092
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,550
get delivered in baptism.

1093
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:25,260
We have seen sick people
get healed in baptism.

1094
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:27,970
We have seen many people
who were not able before

1095
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,660
to receive the baptism
with the Holy Spirit.

1096
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,310
But when they
got baptized in water,

1097
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:37,000
the Holy Spirit came over them
and they started to speak in tongues.

1098
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,190
It is real. I tell you, it is real.

1099
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,860
I don't know how to explain it,
but the Spirit of God came

1100
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:46,220
and I was really baptized in the
Spirit. I really spoke in tongues.

1101
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:02,380
I'm going to pray
and you are going to help me.

1102
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,210
What is your name?
- Kathy.

1103
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:08,930
Kathy has anxiety and she also wants
to get baptized with the Holy Spirit.

1104
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,510
We just met and I talked about baptism
with the Holy Spirit and how it is.

1105
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,640
God,

1106
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,430
I believe in you.

1107
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,690
I believe in you, Jesus.

1108
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,650
I repent.

1109
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,480
And I ask you,

1110
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,190
set me free

1111
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:26,690
from every anxiety

1112
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,530
and come with your Holy Spirit.

1113
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,820
Fill me up.

1114
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,490
Baptize me.

1115
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,830
Right now.

1116
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:36,080
In the name of Jesus.

1117
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:39,670
The Bible is clear that
there is always a sign

1118
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:43,670
when people receive
the baptism with the Holy Spirit.

1119
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:47,170
In the Book of Acts, chapter 8,
we can read about Philip,

1120
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,260
how he came to Samaria
and he preached the gospel.

1121
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:53,760
And people received the message
and they repented

1122
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:57,330
and they got baptized
in water to Jesus Christ.

1123
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,890
But at that time
they had not yet

1124
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,400
received the baptism
with the Holy Spirit.

1125
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:06,320
So when the Apostles
came, they saw

1126
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:09,320
that they have not received the
baptism with the Holy Spirit.

1127
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:11,320
So they laid their hands on them

1128
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:14,620
and they received the baptism
with the Holy Spirit.

1129
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,200
You don't read
right there what happened,

1130
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,730
but you know there was a sign.

1131
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,170
Why?
Because there was a guy, Simon.

1132
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,800
Simon, he saw how
the Holy Spirit was given

1133
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,510
by the hands of the apostles.

1134
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:32,840
And when he saw that,
he wanted the same power,

1135
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,560
that those people on which
he would lay his hands

1136
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,270
would also receive
the Holy Spirit.

1137
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,850
Now we start to speak
in tongues, when I say, "Now"

1138
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,880
just say the first words
and let it out.

1139
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,170
Now.

1140
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,430
Holy Spirit, freedom.

1141
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:57,140
Freedom, right now.

1142
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:04,750
Freedom, right now.
Freedom, freedom.

1143
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,320
Holy Spirit, freedom.

1144
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,550
Freedom, right now.
Come with your strength, right now.

1145
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,040
Strength, strength.

1146
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,730
Yeah, it's cool, isn't it?
I had mine done yesterday.

1147
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,900
He got baptized with
the Holy Spirit yesterday

1148
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,030
and you, today.

1149
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,680
I have never spoken
in tongues before.

1150
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:39,080
How? It just came?
- Yeah.

1151
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,120
How was that?

1152
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,980
That was awesome;
that's crazy amazing.

1153
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,330
Try to imagine that
here in the middle of the street.

1154
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,570
That's awesome, thank you.
Thank you so much.

1155
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:53,010
You go and tell others
now about this.

1156
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,430
I have always felt that if there
are two camps;

1157
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:59,390
if you go to one camp they only
talk about miracles, miracles.

1158
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,520
That didn't seem to make
a lot of sense to me

1159
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:04,560
for the simple reason that
if Jesus only wanted

1160
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:07,480
to help us with miracles
and healing my physical body,

1161
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:09,150
and that's all he wanted to do,

1162
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,730
then it kind of contradicts
this whole aspect of

1163
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,070
God promising to give us believers
a new body one day.

1164
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:18,240
But at the same time, if I go
to the other side of the camp

1165
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:22,540
and I say miracles are not for
today, it's only the Word of God,

1166
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,960
then it contradicts Scripture

1167
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:27,250
because the Scripture says that
the Word will come with power

1168
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,290
and He'll confirm it with power.

1169
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,170
So where is that middle road?

1170
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,460
And the middle road is found
in the Word of God,

1171
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:35,800
where there is
a balance of both;

1172
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:38,010
where we want the Word of God

1173
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,930
to come together
with the power of God

1174
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,230
and actually make a
transformation in people's lives,

1175
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:48,150
where people will truly be
convicted by the Holy Spirit,

1176
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,020
experience a new life,
repent, turn from sin,

1177
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:54,990
not just confess sin,
but forsake sin,

1178
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,740
receive the power of God,

1179
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,240
be baptized in water,
speak in tongues,

1180
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:01,740
and operate on a
day-to-day basis

1181
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:04,540
with the power of God in you

1182
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,620
or rather, in the temple,
which is us.

1183
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:10,500
For years, I just goofed
around with religion.

1184
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:12,340
Then I moved away
from it completely,

1185
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,760
and then there was this hunger
to come back to it.

1186
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:17,680
And as I came back, I realized
there were areas in my life

1187
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:19,890
where I was shut down
in unbelief.

1188
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,060
That doesn't happen for today;
that was only in Jesus' time,

1189
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:24,930
or that's only meant for a few people.

1190
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,810
Then I read the Bible
and it says,

1191
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,270
"These signs will follow
those who believe."

1192
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:33,270
And I'm saying," I am a believer,
why is it not happening?"

1193
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:36,360
And what we need is
to stir each other's faith.

1194
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,160
If I have a team of people
and all doing the same thing,

1195
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,870
I get encouraged in my faith.

1196
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:41,950
The same with you now.

1197
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,160
Today you have a
gift of a language.

1198
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:46,830
If you don't use that gift,
guess what will happen?

1199
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,210
It will fall away.

1200
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,290
What will happen if you
have this in you now

1201
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,130
and you are not going
to read your Bible?

1202
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,050
You will throw it all away.

1203
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,840
Cultivate it;
make it your lifestyle.

1204
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,630
Make God the center of your life

1205
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:01,510
and do what we are doing
to your friends.

1206
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,060
Think of anyone you know,
any one of your friends.

1207
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:05,890
Call them and tell them
what happened.

1208
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,560
Share your testimony
and then you pray for them.

1209
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:10,730
Believe that when you put your
hand to pray,

1210
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,070
I am talking with confidence. Guess
how long have I been doing this?

1211
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:15,980
Since yesterday.
- Today.

1212
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,900
Today is my first day healing people.

1213
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,570
I am praying for healing today.

1214
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,990
Now just imagine,
all that church junk we learned,

1215
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,530
and I could never do anything.

1216
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,740
And now with the power
of God in us,

1217
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,790
you can do it right now,
and actually

1218
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:32,120
look for somebody, pray for them
and you will have a healing.

1219
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,750
That's the power of Jesus Christ.
He is amazing!

1220
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,090
Come on, all come together.
Watch what's happening.

1221
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,960
You will see what
God is going to do.

1222
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,380
Is that awesome?
- Yeah.

1223
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:42,720
Who wants to come first,
who has got a problem?

1224
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:46,220
No, no, really.
- You have got blisters, right now.

1225
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,390
Okay.
- You have got pain in the ankle?

1226
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,940
No, on my foot,
I have got blisters everywhere.

1227
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,360
Okay.
Be healed, in Jesus' name.

1228
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,590
How do you feel?
Move your leg.

1229
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,940
Oh, my God.

1230
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:02,110
No, I don't feel anything.
- Really?

1231
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,620
On a scale of one to ten,
do you feel any pain?

1232
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:07,730
Only two.
- Okay, let's pray again.

1233
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:12,520
Bones, come into alignment.
Be healed, in Jesus' name.

1234
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:16,540
I don't feel anything.
That's crazy.

1235
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:19,110
It is!
Isn't Jesus awesome?

1236
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:23,010
He is amazing, isn't He?
- I love Him.

1237
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,640
Thank you so much.
- Are you sure?

1238
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:28,180
You are not just saying this to please me?
- No, I am being legit.

1239
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,680
I can actually walk.
- Fantastic. Walk and show me. Come on.

1240
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:34,190
No pain at all?
Fabulous.

1241
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:37,460
Praise Jesus, praise Him.
Who is the next?

1242
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:40,940
I have joint pains in my knee.

1243
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,100
Right.
- Yeah.

1244
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,910
How long have you had it for?

1245
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:51,080
It started about the middle of
last year and it comes and goes.

1246
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:53,000
What would you say
is the pain level now?

1247
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,500
Can you feel any pain?

1248
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:57,290
When I put pressure on it.

1249
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,300
Okay, let's pray.

1250
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,340
Knees, joints be healed,
in Jesus' name.

1251
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,510
Move it now
and see how you feel.

1252
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,890
Just move it around.

1253
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,620
That's a bit funny.

1254
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:12,890
It was there two seconds ago
and now it doesn't hurt.

1255
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,640
At all? Completely?

1256
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:16,350
At all. I'm putting
pressure on it.

1257
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,860
If I put pressure on it
normally I feel like...

1258
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,030
Is it completely gone?
- Yeah.

1259
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,320
Praise God for that.

1260
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:25,530
You know how this
healing happened?

1261
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,660
By the power of Jesus.

1262
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,740
It's Jesus that does it, not me.

1263
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:33,120
I am not any special person;
I am just a messenger.

1264
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,790
Anyone else has got anything?
Come on.

1265
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,040
I recently recovered
from a sprained ankle

1266
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,960
and still get pain
every now and again.

1267
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:42,000
Do you have it right now?
- A little bit.

1268
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,590
Move it around and see
what kind of pain you have.

1269
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,410
Yeah, I have got pain.
- Okay.

1270
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,550
Ankles, be healed,
in the name of Jesus.

1271
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,580
Move your ankle.
- That feels weird.

1272
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,420
Come on, walk a little bit.

1273
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,900
That's so...
- Isn't He amazing?

1274
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,320
I am as amazed as you,
because you know what?

1275
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:09,070
I am a new Christian.
I have just been baptized in water.

1276
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:12,080
I have just received
the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

1277
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:15,660
I spoke in a foreign language,
just like the Bible says.

1278
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:17,790
Then the Bible says,
go out and heal people.

1279
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:21,210
Don't listen to the religious
denominations of Christianity.

1280
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,170
That's all rubbish.
That's all religion.

1281
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,260
True followers of Christ
do what Jesus tells us to do,

1282
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,380
and that's what we do.

1283
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,890
We are simple, ordinary people,

1284
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,310
just going out and
listening to what Jesus says.

1285
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,190
How much do you know
about the Holy Spirit?

1286
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,900
And baptism with the Holy Spirit?
- He intercedes for me.

1287
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:49,410
Have you heard about speaking in tongues?

1288
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,910
I have; I have seen it
when I was younger

1289
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:57,540
but I got really scared,
so I wasn't sure what it was,

1290
01:23:57,690 --> 01:24:00,250
with very little understanding
about the Bible

1291
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,460
and how the Holy Spirit works.

1292
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:05,130
It was kind of hard for me
to understand, but

1293
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,950
in the church that I go to
I have not seen it happening yet.

1294
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:12,800
In the Book of Acts, chapter 19,
you read about Paul,

1295
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:16,470
how he came to Ephesus,
where he met some believers.

1296
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:20,640
He did not ask them
which church they attended,

1297
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:22,900
because this is not important.

1298
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,110
He asked them,

1299
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:28,690
"Did you receive the Holy Spirit
when you believed?"

1300
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,570
And those believers had not yet

1301
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,950
got baptized in water
in the name of Jesus Christ

1302
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,540
and they had not yet
received the Holy Spirit.

1303
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:42,790
So Paul, there baptized
them to Jesus Christ

1304
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,590
and when he then laid
the hands on them,

1305
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:50,570
they all received the Holy Spirit
and started speaking in tongues.

1306
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,350
Freedom. Freedom. More.

1307
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,350
More freedom. Freedom, right now.

1308
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:00,680
God, we thank you for your love.
We thank you for your freedom.

1309
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:04,150
Thank you Holy Spirit that you are
filling her up. You are filling her up.

1310
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:12,390
Never the same, never the same.

1311
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,850
How are you?

1312
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:22,060
You felt that... God...

1313
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:29,170
You have never experienced that?

1314
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,460
I will never be the same.

1315
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:33,720
And there in that mall,
I laid the hands on her

1316
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:36,600
and the Holy Spirit
came over her.

1317
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:39,560
She had never experienced
that before.

1318
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:42,390
She was so touched
by the Holy Spirit,

1319
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:47,060
so we decided to go outside
to talk and pray a little more.

1320
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:51,740
Outside, when I prayed for her,
a demon started to manifest.

1321
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,570
I command this spirit,
go right now!

1322
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,360
I command this,
leave her, right now!

1323
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:58,390
There is freedom.
There is freedom.

1324
01:25:58,930 --> 01:25:59,950
Come out! Go!

1325
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,950
Freedom, right now.
Freedom, right now.

1326
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,750
Go!
Go, I command this spirit, go!

1327
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,210
Go! Go! Right now! Go!

1328
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:10,050
Leave her! Leave her!
Right now! Leave her!

1329
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,800
In the beginning, I did not know
exactly what I was praying for,

1330
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,220
but then God revealed it to me.

1331
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:23,270
He showed me a sin in her life
that she had done.

1332
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,560
When I told her that,
she broke down crying

1333
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:31,190
and said, "How did you know,
how did you know this?

1334
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,320
Can God forgive me?"

1335
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:39,240
There, outside that mall
that young girl met God.

1336
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:41,540
It was so strong.
So at one point,

1337
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:44,960
there came three guards
running out and she said,

1338
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,420
"Go away, go away,
I want to talk with them.

1339
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,880
I want to talk with them."

1340
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:52,670
And that day, that girl met God.

1341
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:56,470
Later in the afternoon, she came
and we prayed for her

1342
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:01,160
and she got baptized with the
Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues.

1343
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:08,650
It was very emotional.
And when he was praying for me,

1344
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,770
I have never mentioned it
to him before

1345
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,110
but he did tell me
that I reminded him of

1346
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:21,410
someone who was going
through the same thing.

1347
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,870
And that's when I knew that God

1348
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:27,360
wanted to tell me that day
that He has forgiven me.

1349
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,250
Even though, I didn't want
to forgive myself

1350
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,880
because I thought there is
no forgiveness for such thing.

1351
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:43,600
But that day, God used Torben
to let me know that

1352
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:47,540
He loves me and He forgave me
from what I have done.

1353
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:53,090
And He has allowed me
to experience that.

1354
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:58,300
I will never forget it and
I will never be the same again.

1355
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,080
Can you tell about yesterday

1356
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:07,190
and then what happened today?
- Yeah.

1357
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:19,130
Sorry, I'm just really happy.
I thought about it yesterday.

1358
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,010
It really is His way
of telling me.

1359
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:26,680
Because I was tired
of looking for answers

1360
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:29,430
and I could not
find it anywhere.

1361
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:32,150
There was always
something inside me.

1362
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:37,970
Yesterday it was finalized for me
and I am just really happy for it.

1363
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,100
So today I got baptized.

1364
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,540
I felt really great after.

1365
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:57,670
It's something that I have been
thinking of doing before

1366
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:03,840
but I thought that there are
things I have to do first

1367
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:08,640
before I can do it.
I have to talk to a pastor,

1368
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:11,690
have a couple of seminars
or something like that,

1369
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,050
So, on your own faith
we baptize you to Jesus Christ.

1370
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:20,220
Die with Christ.
Up with Christ.

1371
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,240
God, we thank you for Maria.

1372
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:28,410
We thank you for everything
you have done, God.

1373
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,790
Thank you for what
you did yesterday and today.

1374
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:34,750
Thank you for what you
are going to do in the future, God.

1375
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,130
It's so amazing, how God
really answers prayers

1376
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:43,880
and how He can give you,
in His perfect time,

1377
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,470
the things that you
need to learn

1378
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,750
and the things you need
to know about His love.

1379
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,310
I was actually praying
the night before I met Torben.

1380
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:57,650
I was praying that night on the
highway while I was driving.

1381
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:04,740
I was praying that I would have
this desire in my heart

1382
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:10,450
to know Him and to reach out
and just give everything to Him,

1383
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,290
but I didn't know
where to start.

1384
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:21,510
I felt like I've ran away so far
that... He's not there anymore.

1385
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:24,630
But yesterday He
answered my prayer

1386
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:29,350
and He made me realize
that He was there the entire time.

1387
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:34,640
He was right there, when I
was grieving, when I was depressed.

1388
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:38,810
Depression got me big.

1389
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:45,140
But I'm still here and I'm
a representation of His love.

1390
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,580
I really think that when
the church comes back

1391
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:55,080
to a true baptism,
the true gospel:

1392
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,620
Repent, turn to Christ.

1393
01:30:57,770 --> 01:31:00,590
Be baptized for the
remission of your sins.

1394
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:02,550
Die with Christ
and rise with Christ

1395
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,410
and be filled
with the Holy Spirit.

1396
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:06,630
That would change this world.

1397
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:09,850
What we see in the Book of Acts

1398
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,850
is an organic, dynamic
life with God

1399
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,020
that is not based on hierarchy.

1400
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:23,280
It's not based on programs
or projects.

1401
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:26,530
It's people
who are following Jesus.

1402
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,570
As we are living the
Book of Acts,

1403
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:32,200
we are now seeing
how that plays out in life.

1404
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:35,540
And now, when we look into
that perfect mirror of God's Word,

1405
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:38,040
where it says,
"The Word became flesh."

1406
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:39,790
It's happening in our own lives.

1407
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:43,130
So it's like, we are now looking at
ourselves when we read Scripture.

1408
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,420
I see people
who are fed up with structure.

1409
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:47,550
I see people
who are fed up with traditions.

1410
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:50,470
I see people who will not
accept anything but the truth.

1411
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:53,390
Almost every Christian in the world
wants to see a revival.

1412
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:56,060
But my picture
of revival was like,

1413
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:59,900
some angels from heaven will come,
or a light, and everyone gets started

1414
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,980
and just wake up,
and then we have the revival.

1415
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:08,360
But, what we see today is that
when all Christians on this planet

1416
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:11,620
get activated, start doing
the things the Bible says

1417
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:13,660
we are going to do:
go out, heal the sick,

1418
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:17,200
preach the gospel, lead people
to Christ; then we have the revival.

1419
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:20,920
I believe that the revival has been here
since Jesus came 2000 years ago.

1420
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:24,250
I truly believe
this is the last reformation,

1421
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,920
the last reformation
of the church.

1422
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:29,970
This stuff is real. It's real.
You can do it.

1423
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,180
It's just a case
of going out there

1424
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:35,140
and start working on the street.

1425
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:36,930
We hide a lot of stuff
in the church

1426
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,100
and there is a lot of
bondage in the church,

1427
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:42,400
but we need to get out there
and be doing it, on the edge.

1428
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:46,690
God is real and He called us to
be His disciples, Jesus' disciples,

1429
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,610
to go out and show
the world He is real.

1430
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,430
This is real.

1431
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,070
It is real. I tell you, it is real.

1432
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:57,520
It's real!
It's really real!

1433
01:32:58,100 --> 01:32:59,200
It's really real, y'all!

1434
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,870
This is real!

1435
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:04,130
If this is real in the Bible,
what about the rest?

1436
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,420
Every word is real,
from the beginning to the end.

1437
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:11,470
Real.

1438
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:15,050
This is real.
We are living in the last days,

1439
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,810
where God is bringing His church
back to the truth,

1440
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,810
back to the real life
we have been longing for.

1441
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,440
The real life we have been
reading about in the Book of Acts,

1442
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,530
where the Holy Spirit is leading.

1443
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,820
This is happening, and it's
happening all over the world.

1444
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:37,160
So let us keep the focus,
let us continue making disciples

1445
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:40,370
and let Jesus build His church.

1446
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:44,170
I believe it's
the last reformation

1447
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,650
and this is just the beginning.

1448
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:24,520
Do you still remember the word
I spoke to you?

1449
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:31,610
Do you still remember the dream
I gave to you?

1450
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:38,950
Time passes and the calendar's
filled up.

1451
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:46,770
But one is necessary,
spend time with me.

1452
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:53,570
Wake up, my people.

1453
01:34:53,720 --> 01:35:00,580
Soon, I'm coming back.

1454
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:06,020
One is necessary.

1455
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:09,920
Spend time with me.

1456
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:14,030
I'm guiding you.

1457
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:20,410
If you want to be my disciple,

1458
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:27,590
you must deny yourself
and lay your own dreams down.

1459
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:34,930
Follow me, no matter
what the cost is.

1460
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:42,620
Then you will get eternal life.

1461
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:49,120
Wake up, my people.

1462
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:56,300
Soon, I'm coming back.

1463
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:01,750
One is necessary.

1464
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:05,680
Spend time with me.

1465
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:08,980
I'm guiding you.

1466
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:12,630
Do you have time for me?

1467
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:16,090
To seek my Kingdom,

1468
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,860
to seek my face.

1469
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:21,410
I want to speak to you.

1470
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:24,850
I want to lead you step by step.

1471
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:29,500
I'm calling you.

1472
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:36,130
Will you follow me
no matter what the cost is?

1473
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:49,500
I'm calling you. I'm calling you.

1474
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:59,000
